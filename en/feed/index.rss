			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><p>Amaral, Cyan, Dinero, Klaus &amp; Kinski and La Bien Querida amongst others are music bands represented by this Management group based in Madrid (Spain). Hook Management was founded 28 years ago to promote, represent and produce artists and music bands. In this almost 3 decades of work, their scope has always been to promote good music.</p>
<p>When we started working on their website, they asked us to optimized their site for mobile devices, specially for <strong>iPhone</strong> but also for <strong>Android</strong> and <strong>Blackberry</strong>. To improve the user experience in this kind of devices: We reduced  the content of their site, avoided uncomfortable zooms, simplified the  layout and we had on mind the tactile dimension of these devices.</p>
<p>This kind of optimization did not change their content publishing  workflow, and did not imply a double site maintenance either because  it’s only one website adapting to different devices.</p></p>

		<description><![CDATA[17 triggers are more than an advertising or marketing agency, they are a consulting firm that helps good causes to become even more effective. Marketing for Good Causes is more than their vision – it’s their mantra.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>17 Triggers was founded by three partners: a microfinance expert, a creative marketer and a graphic designer. They had all experienced frustration when their professions either failed to work together or their processes blocked innovation. They all felt it was time for a different approach to marketing, and together they created 17 Triggers. They are more than an advertising or marketing agency, they are a consulting firm that helps good causes to become even more effective.</p>
<p>They believe in the power of marketing for positive change. If marketing   can influence the masses to smoke cigarettes and eat fast food, it can   also inspire people to live healthier and happier lives. From nudging   millions of Indians to save more, to inspiring rural Cambodians to treat   their drinking water, Marketing for Good Causes is more than their  vision  – it’s their mantra.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><p>Laia Abril is a photojournalist from Barcelona based in Treviso (Italy). Apart from being chief editor of Colors Magazine in Fabrica (Benetton), Laia is travelling around the world doing photojournalism. The photographer wanted a site where she could show her work with impact in a clear way. She was very interested also in having website that adapts to the different visitor&#8217;s resources, an <strong>elastic site</strong>.</p>
<p>Working with the elasticity on mind, this website is showing the content in a different way <strong>depending on the screen resolution and the device</strong> of the user. We worked in what it is called a responsive design and development. Because this site is very visual based, we enriched the intereaction for tactile devices ( iPad, iPhone,etc.) so you can browse between the pictures of a photo gallery using swipe gestures.</p></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thomas Giddings is a fashion photographer. He has shot for various clients including British and Russian Vogue, i-D, Jalouse, Topman and Mulberry. He balances his commercial work with personal projects and has recently had his second solo photography show in London where he is currently based.</p>
<p>Thomas contacted us because he couldn&#8217;t update his old website easily. He also had a blog that was not integrated into his site. We designed and developed a new portfolio website, highlighting his work by utilising the entire width of the screen. We also implemented an easy and engaging navigation system and integrated his blog making it more personal and visually more interesting.</p>
<p>After finishing Thomas’s website we were contacted by other clients from the fashion industry, leading to a new website and an online shop coming soon…</p>
